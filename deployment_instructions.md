# Deployment Instructions for Spam Filtering System

## Introduction
This document provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the spam filtering system in different environments.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying the system, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- Python 3.7 or later installed
- Docker installed (if deploying using containers)
- Access to the internet for downloading datasets (if applicable)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Cloning the Repository
Clone the repository containing the spam filtering system to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-filtering-system.git
cd spam-filtering-system
```

### 2. Setting up the Environment
Set up the Python environment and install dependencies:
```bash
# If using virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
# Or
env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Follow the instructions in `data_collection.py` to collect and preprocess data. Ensure that the necessary datasets are available or modify the script to download them.

### 4. Training the Model
Run the `model_training.py` script to train the machine learning model on the preprocessed data:
```bash
python model_training.py
```

### 5. Running the Spam Filter
Execute the `spam_filter.py` script to use the trained model for real-time spam detection:
```bash
python spam_filter.py
```

### 6. Deployment using Docker (Optional)
If deploying using Docker, follow these steps:

#### Build Docker Image
Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile:
```bash
docker build -t spam-filter-app .
```

#### Run Docker Container
Run the Docker container:
```bash
docker run -it spam-filter-app
```

### 7. System Integration
Integrate the spam filtering system into your desired platform or system using appropriate interfaces or APIs.
